# Customer Demographics Analyses For Product Recommendation using ML (Case Study: Bokku Stores)‚Äù
# Project Overview
This project examines the relationship between customer demographics and sales performance, providing insights into effective product recommendations. Using Bokku Stores (a retail mart) as a case study, the goal is to understand which demographic factors influence purchases and build a machine learning model that predicts product recommendations.
The project applies data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to generate insights that can support business decision-making and customer retention strategies
# Objectives
To explore customer demographics (age, gender, location, income) and how they affect product purchases.
To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize purchasing trends.
To train and evaluate machine learning models for product recommendation.
To recommend strategies for improving sales performance based on insights.
# Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration
GitHub for project version control and collaboration
