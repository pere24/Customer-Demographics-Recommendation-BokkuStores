# Customer-Demographics-Recommendation-BokkuStores
# Customer Demographics Analyses For Product Recommendation using ML (Case Study: Bokku Stores)‚Äù
# Project Overview
This project examines the relationship between customer demographics and sales performance, providing insights into effective product recommendations. Using Bokku Stores (a retail mart) as a case study, the goal is to understand which demographic factors influence purchases and build a machine learning model that predicts product recommendations.
The project applies data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to generate insights that can support business decision-making and customer retention strategies
# Objectives
To explore customer demographics (age, gender, location, income) and how they affect product purchases.
To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize purchasing trends.
To train and evaluate machine learning models for product recommendation.
To recommend strategies for improving sales performance based on insights.
# Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration
GitHub for project version control and collaboration
Feature Engineering ‚Äì selecting relevant demographic variables for modeling.
Modeling ‚Äì Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
Model Evaluation ‚Äì accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score.
Recommendations ‚Äì business insights from results.
# Results Summary
Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~0.73
Decision Tree Accuracy: ~0.78
Random Forest Accuracy (Final Model): ~0.80 ‚úÖ
üìå Random Forest was chosen as the best-performing model due to its higher accuracy and balanced performance across classes.
# Future Work
Expand the dataset with more demographic and transactional data.
Implement deep learning recommendation systems.
Could you deploy the model into a web app for real-time product recommendation?
